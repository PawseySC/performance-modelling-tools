If you plan on using the HPC Toolkit from the United States Department of Energy, we first recommend that you install Spack, if you don't already have an installation available. Good practice is to install spack in our $MYGROUP directory on Pawsey systems. git clone https://github.com/spack/spack $MYGROUP/spack source $MYGROUP/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh Mulan GPU profiling with hpc-toolkit is currently not supported on Mulan; hpc-toolkit requires ROCm 5.0.0 or greater.
