# Performance Modeling Tools

This repository hosts configuration files and scripts to support performance modeling of research application on Pawsey Supercomputing Centre systems. 

We provide examples of using the following profilers for hotspot, trace, and events profiling.

* rocprof (AMD GPUs)
* nvprof (Nvidia GPUs)
* HPC Toolkit (CPU, Nvidia GPUs, and AMD GPUs)

Further, Python scripts are provided for processing results to create figures or datasets that can be migrated to other platforms for visualization.
