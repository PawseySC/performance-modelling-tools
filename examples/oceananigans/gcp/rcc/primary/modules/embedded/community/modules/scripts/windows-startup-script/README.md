## Description

This module contains a set of scripts to be used in customizing Windows VMs at
boot or during image building. Please note that the installation of NVIDIA GPU
drivers takes, at minimum, 30-60 minutes. It is therefore recommended to build
a custom image and reuse it as shown below, rather than install GPU drivers at
boot time.

> NOTE: the output `windows_startup_ps1` must be passed explicitly as shown
> below when used with Packer modules. This is due to a limitation in the `use`
> keyword and inputs of type `list` in Packer modules; this does not impact
> Terraform modules

### NVIDIA Drivers and CUDA Toolkit

Many Google Cloud VM families include or can have NVIDIA GPUs attached to them.
This module supports GPU applications by enabling you to easily install
a compatible release of NVIDIA drivers and of the CUDA Toolkit. The script is
the [solution recommended by our documentation][docs] and is [directly sourced
from GitHub][script-src].
